## Description
FitnestX is an application that combine workout app, meals recipes and playlists for meditations in one so that users will no longer need to use separate apps to keep.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: After authorization, you will be directed to a page that visually displays the main features of the application. It includes daily goals, upcoming and completed workouts, as well as a card with recipe information.
- **Daily goals**: You can set daily goals for the desired number of steps and liters of water. They can later modify these goals if needed.
- **Workout programs**: You can choose one of the six suggested workout programs. Each program will offer unique workouts tailored to achieve the selected goal. If desired, you can always modify the workout program.
- **Meditations**: You can create playlists for meditations by selecting a cover and choosing their favorite compositions. Based on the Audio API, a custom audio player interface was created for a better user experience, including automatic playback of subsequent tracks when clicking on the playback of any track - the previously played track is paused. If desired, any of the playlists can always be deleted.
- **Nutrition**: You are provided with recipes for healthy eating, categorized by meals and containing all the necessary information.
- **Achievements**: To enhance engagement in the workout process, a gamification element has been introduced in the form of achievements for completed workouts, creating playlists, and more.
